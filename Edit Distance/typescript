String: Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, He's broken every  human law, he breaks the law of gravity.  His powers of levitation  would make a fakir stare, And when you reach the scene of crime -  Macavity's not there!  You may seek him in the basement, you may look  up in the air - But I tell you once and once again, Macavity's not there!  Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin; You would know him if you saw him, for his eyes are sunken in.  His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed; His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed.  He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake; And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake.
